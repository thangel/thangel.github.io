        *CIVE10006 Hydraulic Engineering IV*

    This is a 4th year undergraduate civil engineering module on unsteady flows delivered since the Spring semester of 2019. I am responsible for the delivery of material on open channel flows and specifically flood routing, St Venant Equations, Solitary Waves, Surges and Coastal Waves. `Course Website <http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/18-19/dpt/cxcive10006.htm>`_

        *CIVE09035 Water  Engineering, Transport & Treatment III*

    A 3rd year undergraduate civil engineering module covering the fundamentals of hydraulic flows since the Autumn semester of 2019. I am responsible for the delivery of material introducing the gradually varied flow equation, the use and rationale of certain flow-control structures, and the application of the momentum and energy principles on open channel flow settings. `Course Website  <http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/cxcive09035.htm>`_

        *Hydraulic Engineering IV*

    .. container :: note2 

        **Role:** Course Organiser

    *Hydraulic Engineering IV* is a 4th year undergraduate civil engineering module on unsteady flows. I am responsible for the delivery of material on open channel flows and specifically flood routing, St Venant Equations, Solitary Waves, Surges and Coastal Waves. `Course Website <http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/18-19/dpt/cxcive10006.htm>`_

        *Water  Engineering, Transport & Treatment III*

    .. container :: note2 

        **Role:** Lecturer

    *Water  Engineering, Transport & Treatment III* is a  3rd year undergraduate civil engineering module where I cover the fundamentals of hydraulic flows since 2019. I am responsible for the delivery of material on the gradually varied flow equation, the use and rationale of certain flow-control structures, and the application of the momentum and energy principles on open channel flow settings. `Course Website  <http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/cxcive09035.htm>`_ 


Educational Resources
=====================

        *Tidal Energy Open Educational Resource*

    .. container :: note2 

        **Role:** Researcher

    The *Tidal Energy Open Educational Resource* (OER)  is intended to provide an overview to initiate students and scholars to the theory and practical aspects  of this form of marine energy, defining certain key concepts and directing the interested reader to useful sources for further information. 

    The research guide is made as an OER by Athanasios Angeloudis as part of the Digital Education module for the Postgraduate Certificate (PgCert) in Academic Practice at The University of Edinburgh and is motivated by the research activities of the NERC project `NE/R013209/2 <http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NE/R013209/2>`_ : Tidal energy operational and spatial planning optimisation:

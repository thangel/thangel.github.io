        *2020*

    - A  study published in *Ocean & Coastal Management* expands on our recent ecohydraulics applications. The work was conducted jointly  with researchers led by Dr Jon Hill from the University of York. The study employs our estuarine modelling to extract information that can be correlated with the behavior of sensitive marine species. A machine learning technique (MaxEnt) is in turn applied to predict changes in their habitat distribution.

    - Our recent work on the operational modelling and the optimisation of linked-basin tidal energy systems has now been published in *Renewable Energy*. The work was a result of a joint effort with researchers of the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London:

    - Our tidal range energy modelling has been applied to assess the available tidal range energy resource in the Gulf of California. The study, published in *Renewable Energy*, was conducted in collaboration with the National Oceanographic Centre, and the Bangor School of Ocean Sciences:

        *2019*

    - Recent progress on tidal range energy income optimisation was presented by `Lucas Mackie <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.mackie18>`_ at EWTEC 2019, demonstrating interesting interactions amongst  tidal power plants, as detailed in the `conference paper <https://www.dropbox.com/s/1za84hyg2cp2tir/EWTEC2019.pdf?dl=0>`_. Lucas also presented a `poster <https://uc054bba4e3ee56cf40c96bd1c83.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/get/AfZmJosRG3uXM4-OFeFwJwKe_smGWvFha_fFhUY_r_-HYgHXXLto8y47yJ2F95QIzlIdo1sxKbVMEDeBojJWD7-0xsaeopFhMSsMRuA1f7ev9WuuTsozGoFnxdbMVTAyh1M/file?raw=1>`_ on his research regarding  the optimisation of  tidal range power plant operation. It was presented at the University of Oxford's `Tidal Energy Workshop <https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/events/7th-oxford-tidal-energy-workshop/>`_.

    - A publication is now available on the assessment of tidal range structure operations at *Dams and Reservoirs*. It highlights that operation optimisation using simplified models is mostly accurate for small schemes, as the larger impact on tidal dynamics invalidates simplified model assumptions.

    - A new paper has been published in *Applied Energy* on the MSc research study of Freddie Harcourt on the flexibility of tidal range power plant operation. It presents recent insights on how this inherent flexibility on generation times could be used to negotiate more attractive subsidy deals and complement other sustainable energy options (e.g. onshore and offshore wind energy).

        *2018*


    - I presented research `updates <http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NE/R013209/1&cookieConsent=A>`_ and an overview of tidal engineering research challenges at the `Energy Futures Lab <http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/administration/energyfutureslab/eventssummary/event_7-9-2018-10-21-39>`_ . A blog post regarding the theme of the talk can be found `here <https://energyfutureslab.wordpress.com/2018/11/15/tidal-lagoon-barrage-power-plants-in-the-uk-operation-assessment-and-optimisation/>`_.

    - Research together with colleagues from Imperial College was presented at the biennial Conference on Renewable Energies Offshore in Lisbon (RENEW 2018). `Zoe Goss <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/z.goss15>`_ presented her `progress <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BjhyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA255&dq=info:8FNPRGtYPSkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a7_8_hMhBw&sig=uBDRPNE1Rq8Gj2VZHTQBYygOB90>`_ on tidal stream energy in Alderney race and I gave a talk on the feasibility and characteristics of `twin-basin lagoons <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BjhyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA159&dq=info:IuP6Re4rgQUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a7_8_hMiyu&sig=Myj9sPWKoXrArxcjPTXqmkyw8AU>`_.

    - Following two uniquely rewarding years at Imperial College with the Department of Earth Science and Engineering, I have joined the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh as a Lecturer in Water Engineering within the `Institute for Infrastructure and Environment <https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/iie>`_.

    - Exceedingly pleased by the acceptance of our paper on tidal lagoon vortices with `Carolanne Vouriot <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/fluid-mechanics/people/carolanne-vouriot/>`_, `Stephan Kramer <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.kramer>`_ and `Matt Piggott <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott>`_. The paper is open access funded by NERC and EPSRC and is accessible at Environmental Fluid Mechanics.

    - Our tidal range energy modelling has been applied to assess the available tidal range energy resource in the Gulf of California. The study, published in *Renewable Energy*, was conducted in collaboration with the National Oceanographic Centre, and the Bangor School of Ocean Sciences:

    - Recent progress on tidal range energy income optimisation was presented by `Lucas Mackie <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.mackie18>`_ at EWTEC 2019, demonstrating interesting interactions amongst  tidal power plants, as detailed in the `conference paper <https://www.dropbox.com/s/1za84hyg2cp2tir/EWTEC2019.pdf?dl=0>`_.

    - `Lucas Mackie <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.mackie18>`_ presented a `poster <https://uc054bba4e3ee56cf40c96bd1c83.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/get/AfZmJosRG3uXM4-OFeFwJwKe_smGWvFha_fFhUY_r_-HYgHXXLto8y47yJ2F95QIzlIdo1sxKbVMEDeBojJWD7-0xsaeopFhMSsMRuA1f7ev9WuuTsozGoFnxdbMVTAyh1M/file?dl=1#>`_ on his research regarding  the optimisation of  tidal range power plant operation. It was presented at the University of Oxford's `Tidal Energy Workshop <https://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/events/7th-oxford-tidal-energy-workshop/>`_.

    - A publication is now available on the assessment of tidal range structure operations at *Dams and Reservoirs*. It highlights that operation optimisation using simplified models is mostly accurate for small schemes, as the larger impact on tidal dynamics invalidates simplified model assumptions. The paper can be accessed `from here <https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/jdare.18.00042?journalCode=jdare>`_.

    - A new paper has been published in *Applied Energy* on the MSc research study of Freddie Harcourt on the `flexibility of tidal range power plant operation <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.12.091>`_. It presents recent insights on how this inherent flexibility on generation times could be used to negotiate more attractive subsidy deals.

        *2018*


    - I presented research `updates <http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NE/R013209/1&cookieConsent=A>`_ and an overview of tidal engineering research challenges at the `Energy Futures Lab <http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/administration/energyfutureslab/eventssummary/event_7-9-2018-10-21-39>`_ . A blog post regarding the theme of the talk can be found `here <https://energyfutureslab.wordpress.com/2018/11/15/tidal-lagoon-barrage-power-plants-in-the-uk-operation-assessment-and-optimisation/>`_.

    - Research together with colleagues from Imperial College was presented at the biennial Conference on Renewable Energies Offshore in Lisbon (RENEW 2018). `Zoe Goss <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/z.goss15>`_ presented her `progress <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BjhyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA255&dq=info:8FNPRGtYPSkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a7_8_hMhBw&sig=uBDRPNE1Rq8Gj2VZHTQBYygOB90>`_ on tidal stream energy in Alderney race and I gave a talk on the feasibility and characteristics of `twin-basin lagoons <http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BjhyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA159&dq=info:IuP6Re4rgQUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a7_8_hMiyu&sig=Myj9sPWKoXrArxcjPTXqmkyw8AU>`_.

    - Following two uniquely rewarding years at Imperial College with the Department of Earth Science and Engineering, I have joined the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh as a Lecturer in Water Engineering within the `Institute for Infrastructure and Environment <https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/iie>`_.

    - Exceedingly pleased by the acceptance of our paper on tidal lagoon vortices with `Carolanne Vouriot <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/fluid-mechanics/people/carolanne-vouriot/>`_, `Stephan Kramer <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.kramer>`_ and `Matt Piggott <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott>`_. The paper is open access funded by NERC and EPSRC and is accessible at `Environmental Fluid Mechanics <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10652-018-9626-4>`_.

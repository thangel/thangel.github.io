Tidal range resource
====================

Let us try to place this energy into context. The maximum theoretical potential energy available from a head difference (or simply, an elevation difference) :math:`H` (m) in Joules is given by the classic study of :cite:`Prandle1984` as:

.. math::
   :label: energy

   E_{max} = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A H^2, 


where :math:`\rho` is the fluid density (kg/m\ :sup:`3`), :math:`g` is the gravitational acceleration (m/s\ :sup:`2`) and :math:`A` is the impounded plan surface area (m\ :sup:`2`). 

If we consider :math:`H` to be the tidal range, the above equation can give us an indication of how much energy is available for extraction. The resource available increases linearly with the impounded area :math:`A`. However the resource is amplified much more when :math:`H` increases through a quadratic relationship. Using the above equation, we can calculate how much tidal energy is encompassed in each transition of the tide, as in Figure 1 below.

The tidal range at a given location does not remain constant. In fact, the tidal elevation at any point is the result of many tidal waves that add up to the overall wave developed :cite:`parker2007tidal`. During spring tides, the principal tide driven by the moon forces (:math:`M_2`)  constructively adds up leading to a greater tidal range, whereas during neap tides the opposite occurs.


By extending the rationale of Figure 1 and equation :eq:`energy` in a realistic sea elevation signal that considers these variations in time we can proceed and quantify how the tidal range energy varies at any point. The Figure is produced for a location at Swansea Bay, UK.

Using this analysis over a year, the available potential energy can be estimated at any point where we might want to exploit this energy source.

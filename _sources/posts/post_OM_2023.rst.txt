Benchmarking a two-way coupled coastal wave–current hydrodynamics model
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent work by Anastasia Fragkou on the benchmarking of wave-current interactions through Thetis and SWAN are now reported in *Ocean Modelling*. This documents our efforts towards coupled modelling

**Abstract**

Wave–current interaction phenomena are often represented through coupled model frameworks in ocean modelling. However, benchmarking of these models is scarce, revealing a substantial research challenge. We seek to address this through a selection of cases for coupled wave–current interaction modelling. This comprises a series of analytical and experimental test cases spanning three diverse conditions of wave run-up, one scenario of waves opposing a current flow, and a 2-D arrangement of waves propagating over a submerged bar. We simulate these through coupling the spectral wave model, Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN), with the coastal hydrodynamics shallow-water equation model, Thetis, using the Basic Model Interface (BMI) structure. By comparing calibrated versus default parameter settings we identify and highlight calibration uncertainties that emerge across a range of potential applications. Calibrated model results exhibit good correlation against experimental and analytical data, alongside benchmarked wave–current model predictions, where available. Specifically, inter-model comparisons show equivalent accuracy. Finally, the coupled model we developed as part of this work showcases its ability to account for wave–current effects, in a manner extensible to other coupled processes through BMI and applicable to more complex geometries.

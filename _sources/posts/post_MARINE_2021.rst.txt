Recent progress on our research was presented by `Lucas Mackie <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.mackie18>`_  and `Joe Wallwork <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.wallwork16>`_ at `MARINE 2021 <https://congress.cimne.com/marine2021/frontal/default.asp>`_, demonstrating our recent insight on the assessment of tidal range schemes, and the use of mesh-adaptive methods on characterising the output of turbines in tidal stream arrays.

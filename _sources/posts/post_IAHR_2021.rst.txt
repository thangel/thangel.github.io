-----------------------------------

Recent progress on our research was presented by `Lucas Mackie <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.mackie18>`_  and Anastasia Fragkou at `IAHR 2020 <https://iahr2020.pl/>`_, demonstrating our recent insight on the calibration of coastal ocean models, and the simulation of 3-D processes associated with plumes from desalination plants.

        *Current Opportunities*

        
    - **I welcome applications for PhD applicants at The University of Edinburgh for research on Offshore, Coastal and Estuarine engineering**.
      I am looking for highly motivated candidates that are keen to conduct computational research that is aligned with the fields of *coastal engineering*, *environmental fluid mechanics* or CFD for *ocean energy* applications. A strong foundation in civil engineering hydraulics and an interest in modern programming techniques (using Python, Matlab, C and FORTRAN) and High-Performance Computing are desirable. For funding options and enquiries please feel free to get in touch by `e-mail <mailto: a.angeloudis@ed.ac.uk>`_.

    
..    - **I am currently offering an opportunity for a PhD studentship at The University of Edinburgh for research on Water & Environmental engineering**.
      I am looking for highly motivated candidates that are keen to conduct computational research that is aligned with the fields of *coastal engineering*, *environmental fluid mechanics* or CFD for *water engineering* applications. A strong foundation in civil engineering hydraulics and an interest in modern programming techniques (using Python, Matlab, C and FORTRAN) and High-Performance Computing will be considered as prerequisites.

..      The funding is sourced from The University of Edinburgh and is available for UK/EU candidates. If you are interested to know more, feel free to contact me by `email`_.

      *PhD Applicants*

   If you wish to study for a PhD and/or attain a studentship at the University of Edinburgh, the first step to join our team is to apply `online <www.eng.ed.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/apply>`_.  During the application process, you will be asked to prepare a research proposal together with the further documentation regarding your background. During this process you will have to specify your preferred supervisor.

   Putting together a robust proposal on a hydro-environmental modelling theme is crucial for your success and you are encouraged to get in touch with any questions. The research proposal itself will not be explicitly binding, and can be formally adapted at a later stage. It is imperative for applicants to  demonstrate traits reflected by academic researchers and specifically for our group, an understanding of contemporary water research challenges. Further documentation to be taken under consideration should be sent directly by `e-mail <mailto: a.angeloudis@ed.ac.uk>`_.
